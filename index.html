												visualized the data to find the missing value. Identified and de-duplicated the data to improve accuracy and efficiency. 
												Analyzed the data to identify numerator drop, explored the states and the claim associated with it. Identified and handled 
												missing values successfully using pandas and the numpy package. The data was also grouped to split, apply, and combine based 
												on category buckets for analysis and exported to an excel file. (Python libraries used: Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn)
